      <div class="description">
        <p>In the United States alone, about 150,000 pounds of food are thrown
         away each day. Food waste is a prevalent problem, whether it is
         due to unclear expiration labels or forgetfulness.</p>
        <p>Our web application strives to help college students reduce
          the amount of food waste tossed. College students have to
          juggle classes, work, and commuting. By exchanging or donating
          food with other students, each user can worry less about what
          they are going to eat each day, and about the money they waste
          by throwing away food they could not eat in time.</p>
        <p>Users can select to Drop Off their food by uploading details
           about the item, where they would like to drop off the food,
           and the time they are available. Users who want to pick up
           food can view items offered for Drop Off that fit their
           schedule and location.</p>
